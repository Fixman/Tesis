In this work, we examine the socio-economic correlations present among users in a mobile phone network in Mexico. First, we find that the distribution of income for a subset of users --for which we have income information given by a large bank in Mexico-- follows closely, but not exactly, the income distribution for the whole population of Mexico. We also show the existence of a strong socio-economic homophily in the mobile phone network, where users linked in the network are more likely to have similar income. The main contribution of this work is that we leverage this homophily in order to propose a methodology, based on Bayesian statistics, to infer the socio-economic status for a large subset of users in the network (for which we have no banking information). With our proposed algorithm, we create an estimator for two categories (low and high income) which significantly outperforms both a simpler method based on a frequentist approach and several common \emph{Machine Learning} methods.
