\section{Accumulated Graph Features}
\label{sec:accumulatedfeatures}

This section presents several ways of transforming data from the graph $G = \left< V, E \right>$ into individual features for each user $v \in V$.

The aggregations are classified into named levels depending on the transformation done to $G$, and they are merged with levels containing less information as specified in \cref{fig:mlrelationships}. The total amount of columns in each featureset is presented in \cref{tab:features}.

\subsection{User Data --- Level $\ego_1$}
\label{subsec:user_data}

The first accumulated features consist of accumulating the three quantifiable features described in \cref{sec:graphfeatures} for every node, separated on whether those features are incoming or outgoing.

\subsection{Higher Order User Data --- Level $\ego_{n > 1}$}

\label{subsec:higherorderuserdata}

The features described in \cref{subsec:user_data} correspond to the information about calls and SMS from a user $v \in V$ towards all of its neighbours. However, there's no reason why this information can't be extended to nodes at a higher distance from $v$.

The \emph{Ego Network} of the node $v$ is defined as the graph consisting of $v$ and its neighbors. A simple way to get more features about that node is to accumulate the call and SMS information about the edges which are \textbf{not} part of the \emph{Ego Network}, but one endpoint on the border of this.

It's possible to define the \emph{User Data of Order $n$}, for any natural number $n$, as the accumulation of call and SMS information for the nodes which are part of the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} and aren't part of the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n - 1$}. The \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} of a certain node $v$ is the subgraph composed of the node $v$, plus all the nodes which are at most at distance $n$ of $v$.

For reference purposes, we assign the level $\ego_1$ to the information of the regular \emph{User Data} from \cref{subsec:user_data}, while the user data from the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} is assigned $\ego_n$ for some $n > 1$\footnotemark{}.

\footnotetext{Note that the first definition isn't necessary; we could just say that the \emph{User Data of Order 1} contains information about the edges adjacent to \emph{Ego Network of Order 1}, which are the edges user in the regular User Data. This is the reason why the \emph{User Data} has level $\ego_1$.}

\subsection{Categorical User Data --- Level $\cat_n$}
\label{subsec:categoricaluserdata}

Another approach to building features for the test is to combine the information contained in $E$, the list of edges, with the one in the ground truth $T \subseteq V$, which says whether a certain node represents a person of \emph{High Income} or a person of \emph{Low Income}.

\input{results_table}

A simple way to do that is to do an approach similar to the \emph{User Data} presented in \cref{subsec:user_data}, but further discriminating each feature which corresponds to a node $v \in V$ and an edge $e \in E$ when $t \in T$ is the other endpoint of $e$ on whether $t$ corresponds to a person with high or low income. The resulting new features are of the form represented by the set in \cref{eq:matcatuserdata}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{Bmatrix} in \\ out \end{Bmatrix}
\times
\begin{Bmatrix} calls \\ time \\ sms \\ contacts \end{Bmatrix}
\times
\begin{Bmatrix} low \\ high \end{Bmatrix}
\label{eq:matcatuserdata}
\end{equation}

Creating these features na√Øvely will occur in overfitting, since the features are generated by data that's also used for training the supervised learning models. To solve this, the set $T$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets, $G$ and $H$, where $G$ contains roughly 0.75 of the nodes in $T$ is used to calculate the features, while $H$ contains the other 0.25 and is used to train the models.

It's possible to use the method presented in \cref{subsec:higherorderuserdata} generate an \emph{Ego Network of level $n$} of a certain node $v$, and accumulate the adjacent nodes to that network by socioeconomic level before accumulating their data. We refer to the level of these features as $\cat_n$.
