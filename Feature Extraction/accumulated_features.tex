\section{Accumulated Graph Features}
\label{sec:accumulatedfeatures}

This section presents several ways of transforming data from the graph $G = \left< V, E \right>$ into individual features for each user $v \in V$.

The aggregations are classified into levels named according to the transformation done to $G$, and they are merged with levels containing less information as specified in \cref{fig:mlrelationships}. The total amount of columns in each feature set is presented in \cref{tab:features}.

\subsection{User Data --- Level $\ego_1$}
\label{subsec:user_data}

The first accumulated features consist of aggregating the three quantifiable features (\emph{Calls}, \emph{Time}, and \emph{SMS}) described in \cref{sec:graphfeatures} for every node, separated on whether those features are incoming or outgoing.

Additionally, we add two features corresponding to the \emph{In-Degree} and \emph{Out-Degree} of each node. This can be seen as the sum of an imaginary feature on each link $e \in E$, \textbf{Contacts}, which is always exactly $1$ when the link exists.

These features are defined for each node $v \in V$ in Equations \eqref{eq:user_data1} to  \eqref{eq:user_data4}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\begin{aligned}
\incontacts_v &= \left| \left\{ e \in E \mid e_d = v \right\} \right| \\
\outcontacts_v &= \left| \left\{ e \in E \mid e_o = v \right\} \right|
\end{aligned}
\end{gathered}
\label{eq:user_data1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\incalls_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_d = v}} \calls_e &
\outcalls_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_o = v}} \calls_e \\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:user_data2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\intime_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_d = v}} \etime_e &
\outtime_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_o = v}} \etime_e \\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:user_data3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\insms_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_d = v}} \sms_e &
\outsms_v &= \sum_{\substack{e \in E \\ e_o = v}} \sms_e \\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:user_data4}
\end{equation}


These accumulated patterns present interesting distributions,
which are characteristic of mobile phone datasets. These distributions are presented in Figures \ref{fig:callsms}, \ref{fig:time}, and \ref{fig:contacts}.

\subsection{Higher Order User Data --- Level $\ego_{n > 1}$}

\label{subsec:higherorderuserdata}

The features described in \cref{subsec:user_data} correspond to the information about calls and SMS from a user $v \in V$ towards all its neighbours. 
However, there's no reason why this information can't be extended to nodes at a higher distance from $v$.

The \emph{Ego Network} of the node $v$ is defined as the graph consisting of $v$ and its neighbors. A simple way to get more features about that node is to accumulate the call and SMS information about the links with nodes which are \textbf{not} part of the \emph{Ego Network}, but have a direct link with the border of the \emph{Ego Network}.

Additionally, we define the distance between two nodes using the intuitive definition which is presented on \cref{eq:distance}, that is the minimum number of hops.
The \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} of a certain node $v$ is the subgraph composed of the node $v$, plus all the nodes which are at most at distance $n$ of $v$, with the distance defined as in \cref{eq:distance}.
We can now define the \emph{User Data of Order $n$}, for any natural number $n$, as the accumulation of call and SMS information for the nodes which are part of the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} and are not part of the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n - 1$}, which we call the $\ego_n$.

\begin{equation}
d \left( a, b \right) =
\begin{cases}
	0 & \text{if } a = b \\
	1 + \min_{v \in \neigh \left(b \right)} d \left( a, v \right) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:distance}
\end{equation}

This definition can be seen intuitively in \cref{fig:higherorderuserdata}. For reference purposes, we assign the level $\ego_1$ to the information of the regular \emph{User Data} from \cref{subsec:user_data}, while the user data from the \emph{Ego Network of Order $n$} is assigned $\ego_n$ for some $n > 1$. % \footnotemark{}.

% \footnotetext{The first part of the definition isn't actually necessary, since $\ego_1$ already contains the user data from the \emph{Ego Network of Order 1}.}

\label{fig:higherorderuserdata}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Categorical User Data --- Level $\cat_n$}
\label{subsec:categoricaluserdata}

Another approach to building features for the test is to combine the information contained in $E$, the list of edges, with the information of the ground truth $T \subseteq V$, which indicates whether a certain node represents a person of \emph{High Income} or a person of \emph{Low Income}.

\input{results_table}

A simple way to proceed is to use an approach similar to the \emph{User Data} presented in \cref{subsec:user_data}, but further discriminating each feature which corresponds to a node $v \in V$ and an edge $e \in E$, where $t \in T$ is the other endpoint of $e$, on whether $t$ corresponds to a person with high or low income. The resulting new features are of the form represented by the set in \cref{eq:matcatuserdata}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{Bmatrix} in \\ out \end{Bmatrix}
\times
\begin{Bmatrix} calls \\ time \\ sms \\ contacts \end{Bmatrix}
\times
\begin{Bmatrix} low \\ high \end{Bmatrix}
\label{eq:matcatuserdata}
\end{equation}

It is important to keep in mind that not all edges of $G$ will be accumulated with these features. Indeed, the majority of users in the testing set $T$ don't have a neighbour which also belongs to $T$, and for those nodes every feature in this category ends up being $0$.

For our experimental setting, the set of nodes $F \subseteq T$ is defined as the nodes in the \emph{Inner Graph} (in contrast to the \emph{Full Graph}, that contains all nodes in $T$), where $F$ only contains nodes which have at least one neighbour with socioeconomic information. In \cref{sec:results} we provide experimental results on both graphs. As expected, the results obtained on the \emph{Inner Graph} are better than the ones obtained on the \emph{Full Graph}, since it contains more information.

Creating these features na√Øvely could occur in overfitting, if the model features were generated with data that is also used for training the supervised learning models. To avoid this overfitting, the set $T$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets, $G$ and $H$, where $G$ contains roughly 75\% of the nodes in $T$ and is used to calculate the features, while $H$ contains the other 25\% and is used to train the models.

We can then use the method presented in \cref{subsec:higherorderuserdata} generate an \emph{Ego Network of level $n$} of a certain node $v$, and accumulate the adjacent nodes to that network by socioeconomic level before accumulating their data. We refer to the level of these features as $\cat_n$.
