Supervised machine learning algorithms that predict features of users based on both existing data of others and information about their social network graph allow us to easily use existing information in existing communications networks to predict unknown data about their users. While these algorithms are still in their infancy, they are still used all over the industry and academia.

This paper presents several feature extraction methods and compares their ability to predict income inference using different metrics.
