The data used in this study contains a set $P$ of \textit{Call Detail Records} (CDRs), composed of voice calls and another set $S$ containing text messages, from a telecommunication company (\textit{telco}) in a Latin American country for a period of 3 consecutive months. Using this data we create the social graph $G = \left< V, E \right>$ where each $v \in V$ is a user of the telco, and $E$ contains calls between those users. Each element $e \in E$ contains informabion about the \emph{Origin} and \emph{Destination} users, in addition to the amount of \emph{Calls}, the total call \emph{Time}, and the amount of \emph{SMS} exchanged.

Additionally, we have access to information about a set $B$ of bank accounts, for which we calculate the monthly income for each user $p_s$. In this paper we separate the users into two groups of equal size: \emph{Low Income}, and \emph{High Income}.

$B$ contains information about the users' telephone number, which is anonymized the same way than the telco data.  Therefore, we can match the data in these two datasets in order to construct the \emph{Ground Truth} $T \subseteq V$, where each element of $T$ contains its income category, along with the \emph{Inner Graph} $G' = \left< V', E' \right>$ where E' contains edges where at least one endpoint is in $T$, and $V'$ is the set of endpoints of all elements in $E'$.
