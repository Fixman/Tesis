\section{Results and Conclusion}
\label{sec:results}

% The results table should have been included earlier, so that the figure can be presented in two columns in this page. Due to limitations on my knowledge of LaTeX, I don't know how to do this inline.

The predictors were run in \todo{Add machine information} with lots of RAM using the \texttt{sklearn} library of Python 2.7. The results of the inference can be found in Table~\ref{tab:comparison}.

We can reach the conclusion than both adding features of a larger \emph{Ego Network} and separating those links via the labels can improve every metric, but the latter features tend to improve them even furtherm, even when taking the entire graph. Additionally, and particularly when comparing predictors with large amount of features, the \emph{Random Forest} tends to be more accurate and much faster than a \emph{Logistic Regression}.
