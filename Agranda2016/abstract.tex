%The explosion of mobile phone communications in the last years occurs at a moment where data processing power increases exponentially.  Thanks to those two changes in a global scale, the road has been opened to use mobile phone communications to generate inferences and characterizations of mobile phone users.

In this work we examine the socio economic correlations present among users in a mobile phone network in Mexico. First we find that the distribution of income for a subset of users for which we have income information given to us by a large bank in Mexico, follows closely but not exactly, the income distribution for the whole population of Mexico. We then go on to show the existence of a strong socio economic homophily in the mobile phone network where users linked in the network are more likely to have similar income. The main contributions of this work is that we leverage this homophily to propose a methodology, based on Bayesian statistics, to infer the socio economic status for a large subset users in the network for which we have no banking information. With our proposed algorithm we achieve an accuracy of 0.71 in a two class classification problem (low and high income) which significantly outperformes a simpler methods based on a frequentist approach for which the accuracy was 0.66. Finally, we extend the two class classification problem to multiple classes.
