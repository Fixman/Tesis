The explosion of mobile phone communications in the last years occurs in a moment where data processing power increases exponentially.  Thanks to those two changes in a global scale, the road has been opened to use mobile phone communications to generate inferences and characterizations of mobile users.

In this work, we use the communications graph and users attributes to gain a better understanding of the demographic features of a population. Namely, we use 
call detail records and banking information to infer the socioeconomic status of each person in the graph.
